# RockPaperScissors
A simple command line rock, paper, scissors game

This simple rock paper scissors game is suited for beginners as it does not involve advanced python concepts. 
The game uses basic classes and functions. Soem nested functions are used, but that does nto make the code too difficult for beginners. 

I hope you understand the code. If you would like to make any changes, feel free to do so.
